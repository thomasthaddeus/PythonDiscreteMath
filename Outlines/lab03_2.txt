12.6 LAB: Warm up: Creating passwords

(1) Prompt the user to enter two words and a number, storing each into separate variables. Then, output those three values on a single line separated by a space. (Submit for 1 point)

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy

the output after the prompts is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6

Note: User input is not part of the program output.

(2) Output two passwords using a combination of the user input. Format the passwords as shown below. (Submit for 2 points, so 3 points total).

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy
6

the output after the prompts is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6

First password: yellow_Daisy
Second password: 6yellow6


(3) Output the length of each password (the number of characters in the strings). (Submit for 2 points, so 5 points total).

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy

the output after the prompts is:

First password: yellow_Daisy
Second password: 6yellow6

Number of characters in yellow_Daisy: 12
