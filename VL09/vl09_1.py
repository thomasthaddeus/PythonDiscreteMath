"""31.10.1: LAB: Descending selection sort with output during execution

Write a program that takes an integer list as input and
    sorts the list into descending order using selection sort.
The program should use nested loops and output the list after each iteration of the outer loop,
thus outputting the list N-1 times (where N is the size of the list).

Ex: If the input is:

20 10 30 40

the output is:

[40, 10, 30, 20]
[40, 30, 10, 20]
[40, 30, 20, 10]

Ex: If the input is:

7 8 3

the output is:

[8, 7, 3]
[8, 7, 3]

Note: Use print(numbers) to output the list numbers and achieve the format shown in the example."""
